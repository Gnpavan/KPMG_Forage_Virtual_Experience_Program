- The profit margin between male and femali is almost equal and the orders are also equally split between online and offline orders.
- As per the data profit iscalculated by subtracting standard cost from the list price, so yeah one gets the doubt like the profit is almost douvle the cost but what I make out of it the standard cost is exclusive of the marketing costs, taxes, labour charges etc..
- Mass customers give higher profits and New Sount Wales is the state which generates higher profits.
- Health, manufacturing and financial services are major industries with higher profits.
- People of age between 36 to 50 have good sale number and profit %.

## **Project Recommendations:**

- Structuring the data or sticking to one data formating is ideal.
- Avoid missing valus, follow correct naming conventions.
- Conduct surveys to better understand the needs of the senior customers and provide with some perks and discounts to attract them.
- Comcemtrate on industries like entertainment, IT, agriculture and telecommunication to improve the sales.

## **Project Outcomes:**

- Completed a simulation focused on advising a client on customer targeting with the Data, Analytics & Modelling team
