# **KPMG Virtual Experience Program by Forage**

## **Project Overview:**

An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.
Social Buzz has over 100.000 posts per day, that can be assumed to have 36.500.000 posts per year. We will analyze the sample of this dataset from them.

Above is the dashboard I have built with the online retail dataset received from the team. They wanted to understand the better performing countries, top customers, sales by year so that the visuals helps in forecasting the trends of the upcoming years and also they hope the insights would help in understanding the flaws with the sales.

- United Kingdom is making sales by huge margin when compared to others and is a flag to note.
- As their major focus was to look at thar 2011 year sales as that was the best compared to 2023, they had exceptional growth in their revenue from the month August to Nivember.
- It clearly shows that the quantity of products with lesser unit price have more sales.

## **Project Recommendations:**

- The company should come up with strategies that aim at stocking and advertising seasonal products to maximize sales when the demand for these goods goes up.
- The company should do a deeper analysis of products that are usually in high demand during low sales months to come up with strategies for marketing these products.
- A deeper dive into the type of products and the revenue generated from these products for each region would be key in guiding region-specific marketing strategies.
- The company should consider incentivizing top revenue generating customers to strengthen the relationship with these customers.

## **Project Outcomes:**

- Completed a simulation involving creating data visualizations for Tata Consultancy Services
- Prepared questions for a meeting with client senior leadership
- Created visuals for data analysis to help executives with effective decision making
